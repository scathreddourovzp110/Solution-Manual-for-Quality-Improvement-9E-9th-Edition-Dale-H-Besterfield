  * Formerly titled Quality Control, the field’s most accessible introduction to quality has been renamed and revamped to focus on quantitative aspects of quality improvement. New chapters on Lean Enterprise, Six Sigma, Experimental Design, and Taguchi’s Quality Engineering have been added, and this new Ninth Edition adds comprehensive coverage of fundamental statistical quality improvement concepts. A practical state-of-the-art approach is stressed throughout, and sufficient theory is presented to ensure that students develop a solid understanding of basic quality principles. To improve accessibility, probability and statistical techniques are presented through simpler math or developed via tables and charts. As with previous editions, this text is written to serve a widely diverse audience of students, including the growing number of “math shy” individuals who must play key roles in quality improvement.
